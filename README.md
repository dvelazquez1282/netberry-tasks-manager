## Topics to analize
- To use ngxs plugin in order to work with a state management pattern
- Add i18n plugin for translation
- To separate the system in a share module + feature modules (for example a module for task management)
- Create a template component for the modals
- Create a abstract class for the forms (with new, edit, save and update methods)
- Implemente a privilege services (methods by profile and by specific privilege)
- Add noty plugin for message notifications (success operation and erros)
- Manage the token expiration
- Create or use a generic component for tables
- Implement Pagination, filters, ordering (we could create a abstract service for all tables)
- Bulk action: for example delete (with a confirmation modal)
